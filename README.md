# StudentMealPlanner (Leftover Chef) 🍲✨

Welcome to the StudentMealPlanner project, where sustainability meets deliciousness! This collaborative effort emerged from the Exeter Google Code Club Code Jam, where our talented team had a week to cook up a software solution focused on promoting sustainability.

## About the Project

🌱 The Student Meal Planner is a revolutionary application designed to tackle the challenges of tight student budgets, curb food waste, and offer a plethora of nutritious meal options. This eco-conscious initiative not only helps students make the most out of their resources but also contributes to a greener planet.

🚀 Our Tech Stack: Python Flask powers the backend, while Node.js and React work seamlessly for the frontend. The whole orchestra is harmonized with SQLite3 for the database.

## Installation Guide

Getting started is a breeze! Follow these steps:

1. Install Python Flask:
```pip install Flask```

2. Run the webserver:
```python3 runserver.py```

3. Connect to the Web Server and Voilà!
